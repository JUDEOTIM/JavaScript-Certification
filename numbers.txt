How Do the Increment and Decrement Operators Work?
If you're working with numbers and need to increase or decrease a value by one, the increment and decrement operators make the job easier. Let's break it down in a simple way.

The increment and decrement operators are represented by ++ and --, respectively. They both allow you to adjust the value of a variable by 1.

Instead of writing something like x = x + 1 or x = x - 1, you can simply use x++ to add 1, or x-- to subtract 1. It's faster, cleaner, and easier to read.

There's a twist to how the increment and decrement operators work: they come in two forms, prefix and postfix, with the difference being when the value gets updated. For the increment operator, prefix is ++x and postfix is x++.

Prefix (++x) increases the value of the variable first, then returns a new value. Postfix (x++) returns the current value of the variable first, then increases it:

1234
let x = 5;

console.log(++x); // 6
console.log(x); // 6
6
6

In the code above, ++x means "increment x first, then use it". So when you log ++x, you immediately get the incremented value, which is 6.

Now, let's take a look at an example using the postfix:

1234
let y = 5;

console.log(y++); // 5
console.log(y); // 6
5
6

In this example, y++ means "use y first, then increment it". When you log y++, you get 5, but y becomes 6 after that line of code.

The decrement operator does the same thing as increment, except it decreases the value by 1. Again, there are two forms: prefix (--x) decreases the value of the variable first, then returns the new value. And postfix (x--) returns the current value first, then decreases it:

1234567
let x = 5;
console.log(--x); // 4
console.log(x); // 4

let y = 5;
console.log(y--); // 5
console.log(y); // 4
4
4
5
4

So, which should you use: prefix or postfix? In many cases, it doesn't matter which one you use. Both get the job done. However, if you're using the value immediately in an expression, the difference becomes important. Let's take a look at this example:

1234567
let a = 5;
let b = ++a;
console.log(b); // 6 (a was incremented before assignment)

let c = 5;
let d = c++;
console.log(d); // 5 (c was incremented after assignment)
6
5

So, if you need the updated value right away, use prefix. If you want the current value first and you don’t care about the increment until later, go with postfix.

What Are Compound Assignment Operators in JavaScript, and How Do They Work?
In JavaScript, all arithmetic operators have a compound assignment form. Compound assignment operators provide a concise shorthand for an operation on a variable followed by storing the result in that same variable. They combine the operation and assignment into a shorter form like x += y, which is equivalent to writing x = x + y but without repeating the variable name. Instead of writing something like this:

1234
let num = 5;
num = num + 2;

console.log(num); // 7
7

You can write something like this:

1234
let num = 5;
num += 2;

console.log(num); // 7
7

Notice how num += 2 combines both the addition and assignment steps into one. This saves time and reduces clutter in your code. Let's dive deeper into the most common compound assignment operators in JavaScript.

As you've already seen, the += operator lets you add a value to an existing variable. It is known as the addition assignment operator. The addition assignment operator takes the current value of the variable, adds the specified number to it, and then assigns the result back to the variable:

1234
let total = 10;
total += 5;

console.log(total); // 15
15

As you might guess, there's a subtraction assignment operator denoted by -=. The subtraction assignment operator subtracts the specified value from the current value of the variable and assigns the new value back to the variable:

1234
let score = 20;
score -= 7;

console.log(score); // 13
13

If you didn't use the subtraction assignment, you'd have done something like this:

1234
let score = 20;
score = score - 7;

console.log(score); // 13
13

The multiplication assignment operator is represented by *=. It multiplies the current value of the variable by the specified number and reassigns it back to the variable:

1234
let points = 5;
points *= 3;

console.log(points); // 15
15

Lastly, there's a division assignment operator denoted by /=. Just like others before it, it lets you divide the current value of a variable by a number you specify, then assign the result back to the variable:

1234
let balance = 100;
balance /= 4;

console.log(balance); // 25
25

Remember there's a compound assignment operator for every operator in JavaScript. So, apart from the four already mentioned, we also have:

Remainder assignment operator (%=), which divides a variable by the specified number and assigns the remainder to the variable.

Exponent assignment operator (**=), which raises a variable to the power of the specified number and reassigns the result to the variable.

Bitwise AND assignment operator (&=), which performs a bitwise AND operation with the specified number and reassigns the result to the variable.

What Are Unary Operators, and How Do They Work?
Unary operators act on a single operand to perform operations like type conversion, value manipulation, or checking certain conditions. Let's look at some common unary operators and how they work.

The unary plus operator converts its operand into a number. If the operand is already a number, it remains unchanged.

123456
const str = '42';
const strToNum = +str;

console.log(strToNum); // 42
console.log(typeof str); // string
console.log(typeof strToNum); // number
42
"string"
"number"

Unary plus is handy when you want to make sure you're working with a numeric value. As you might guess, there's a unary negation operator. It negates the value of the operand. It works similarly to the unary plus, except it flips the sign.

123456
const str = '42';
const strToNegativeNum = -str;

console.log(strToNegativeNum); // -42
console.log(typeof str); // string
console.log(typeof strToNegativeNum); // number
-42
"string"
"number"

The logical NOT operator, represented by an exclamation mark (!), is another unary operator. It flips the boolean value of its operand. So, if the operand is true, it becomes false, and if it's false, it becomes true. 

12345
let isOnline = true;
console.log(!isOnline); // false

let isOffline = false;
console.log(!isOffline); // true
false
true

The bitwise NOT operator is a less commonly used unary operator. Represented by a tilde, ~, it inverts the binary representation of a number. Computers store numbers in binary format (1s and 0s). The ~ operator flips every bit, meaning it changes all 1s to 0s and all 0s to 1s. You will learn more about binary and bits in a future lesson.

123
const num = 5; // The binary for 5 is 00000101

console.log(~num); // -6
-6

In this example, 5 became -6 because by applying the ~ operator to 5, you get - (5 + 1), which equals -6 due to two's complement representation. Two's complement is a way computers represent negative numbers in binary. You probably won't use the bitwise NOT often unless you're working with low-level programming tasks like manipulating bits directly.

The void keyword is a unary operator that evaluates an expression and returns undefined.

123
const result = void (2 + 2);

console.log(result); // undefined
undefined

void is also commonly used in hyperlinks to prevent navigation:

<a href="javascript:void(0);">Click Me</a>
Finally, there is the typeof operator which you learned about in previous lessons. This returns the type of its operand as a string.

123
const value = 'Hello world';

console.log(typeof value); // string
"string"
